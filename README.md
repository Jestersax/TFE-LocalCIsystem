# TFE-LocalCIsystem


Here, I'm about to explain how to install and configure the local system for continous integration of code that I designed as part of my  Bachelor Thesis (Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering)

This system includes Gitea as code host, Jenkins as the automation server, and SonarQube for analyzing the code included in Gitea, generating quality metrics so you can get info about the reliability, availability, usability and security of the software you would be developing.
